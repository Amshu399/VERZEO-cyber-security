SQL Injection:

Steps for SQL injection:          website-(http://testphp.vulnweb.com/)

1. you need to whether the given website is connected to DATBASE or not (numerical numbers like id= ? in url's)
2. we will check the existance of vulnerability  (insert a ' after numerical number)
	No error / page is same --- secured
	error / page is changed / some changes done in webpage --- vulnerability
3. we are going to check how many public columns are available (order by 1,2,3 etc)
	no error --- column in present
	error --- column is not present
	11 columns are in public
4. we need to find how many columns are having loop holes / vulnerbilites using
	union select 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11
5. we need to find database name (remove 9 in url and enter database()  --- DB name : acuart
6. we need to find the table names from database (group_concat(table_name) from informartion_schema.tables where table_schmea=database()

	artists,carts,categ,featured,guestbook,pictures,products,users
	Target : Users

7. we need to find columns from users tables (replace table with column)
	username,password,email,name.
	Target: username,password,address,email

8. we need information from databse about selected columns (replace column name with uname,pass,address,email)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Mistakes done by developer or company:

1.Database Admin ---> did not make data base not secured , the data base is accepting commands from end user from url
2.web developer   ---> it dose not showpage has to redirect to 404 error page when url changed
3.system admin / network admin ---> firewall not configured properly because it was bypassed by hex decimals in url's

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Phishing attack:

These attacks can be done by anonimous links sent by someone,so never do the below things-
1.Never click on Hyperlinks in Email
2.Never enter sensitive data in a (Pop Up Window)
3.Verify HTTPS on address bar
4.Education on Phishing attacks
5.Keep Antivirus Protection Current
6.Utilize Anti Spam Software
7.Utilize Anti Spy Software
8.Install and maintain a reliable Firewall
9.Protect against DNS pharming attacks
10.Utilize Backup System copies

target : anyone who is using socal news sites

Steps to do pishing attack
required

1.html file ---> original facebook page 
2.php file ---> malicious code will be there (imp)
3. txt file will be used to save uid & pwd

*save original html file

*download php script (https://www.geekstorgeeks.org/how-to-create-a-facebook-phishing-page!) 
*Save php file (facebook.php) & txt file with name (log.txt)
*edit html file -- find keyword "action="
*replace origini link with php script file name
* create a free website and upload these files on website
*we need to give full permissions for 3 files
* hacker will send phishing link to victim

Bypass Authentication:

Our target: Websites Admin Panel or Admin login page

Websites:   http://demo.testfire.net/login.jsp


1. we will be having admin login pages.

2.Search for Admin pages in google ---> (http://demo.testfire.net/login.jsp) admin pages

3.Attackers using google dorks  and by advnaced searching in google ,attacker first uses default uid and pass like

uid:admin   ,  pass:admin
uid:admin   ,  pass:password
uid:Admin   ,  pass:Admin@123   ,ETC

If he failed then he uses

uid: 1'or'1'='1 
pass:1'or'1'='1

admin'or'1'='1 (true)
login'or'1'='1  (true)

Logic behind Database is

uid	pass	Result
T	F	F
F	T	F
T	T	T


Reporting to the client:

1.Take Screenshots (Before attack & After Attack)
2.Give the Payload we have used to crack their authentication---> 1'or'1'='1

Mistakes by the company's developers:

1. The Web developer allowed alpha numeric only keys in username 
2. Database Admin did not encrypted  data in database
